The central logic for:
- Managing state for all notes
- Adding new notes
- Passing props to child components

### 2. `EditableNote.jsx`
Handles:
- Display and editing of individual notes

Style rules for both global layout and specific components. Uses:
- Flexbox and Grid for layout
- Media queries for mobile responsiveness
- Custom themes and hover effects

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

The app is responsive and mobile-friendly:
- For screens ≤ 500px width, layout switches to a vertical scrollable format.
- Buttons and text areas adapt size and spacing for comfortable mobile use.

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

This app can be used as a:
- Quick notes manager during work or study
- Idea board for creative writing or journaling
- Task list manager (lightweight TODO app)
- Reference tool for learning React CRUD operations

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

Although the app works well, here are a few future enhancements that can be added:

- 🌐 LocalStorage/IndexedDB support for persistence
- 📦 Export all notes as a ZIP or single file
- 🔍 Search/filter functionality
